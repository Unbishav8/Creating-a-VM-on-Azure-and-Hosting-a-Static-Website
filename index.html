            <p>Cloud computing refers to the delivery of various services over the internet, enabling users to access and store data, run applications, and manage resources remotely rather than on local servers or personal devices. These services are typically provided by third-party vendors, who maintain the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics of Cloud Computing:</h3>
            <p><b>1.On-Demand Self-Service:</b> Users can access computing resources, such as storage and processing power, whenever needed, without human intervention from the service provider.</p><br>
            <p><b>2.Broad Network Access:</b> Cloud services are accessible over the internet from various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.</p><br>
            <p><b>3.Resource Pooling:</b> Providers pool resources to serve multiple customers, using a multi-tenant model where resources are dynamically allocated and reallocated according to demand.</p><br>
            <p><b>4.Rapid Elasticity:</b> Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to accommodate changes in workload or demand.</p><br>
            <p><b>5.Measured Service:</b> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage by leveraging a metering capability, so customers are billed based on their actual usage.</p>
